(9/26) Wrote a tester to delete git over and over again, and has different methods for cleaning up (deleting everything in git and git itself), and for checking if a file exists. I made sure cleanup checks if the file exists before trying to delete it. My implementation is reliable because my code is clear and I check for edge cases.

(9/26) I wrote a hasher to hash SHA-1 and I also made a test file called hTest that has stuff written in it to run my hash tester on. It worked when i checked it online too! I also account for if the file doesn't exist. TBH I copied my code from sha-256 assignment. 

(10/9) I found a small bug where the trees and blobs were not being saved to the objects folder. Fixed this in the recursive method to ensure files are written to the correct folder for git functionality.
